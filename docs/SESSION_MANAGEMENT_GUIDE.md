## üîß Running Session Procedure

### **Development Phase Structure (40-45 minutes)**

#### **Phase 1: Implementation (30-35 minutes)**
```
üéØ Primary Focus: [Main component from objectives]

Implementation approach:
1. Interface definition (5-8 minutes)
2. Core implementation (15-20 minutes)  
3. Integration points (5-8 minutes)
4. Basic testing (5 minutes)

Real-time tracking:
- Update CURRENT_CONTEXT.md every 15 minutes
- Note architectural decisions immediately
- Document integration changes as they happen
```

#### **Phase 2: Integration & Documentation (10-15 minutes)**
```
üîó Integration tasks:
1. Connect with existing components
2. Update interface contracts
3. Verify integration points work
4. Document any breaking changes

üìã Documentation updates:
- COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md: Update component status
- INTEGRATION_MAP.md: Add/modify interfaces
- Note any architecture changes
```

### **Real-Time Session Tracking**

#### **CURRENT_CONTEXT.md Updates**
Update every 15 minutes with:
```markdown
## Session [X] Progress - [TIMESTAMP]

### Completed This Block
- [x] Specific task completed
- [x] Integration point working

### Currently Working On  
- [ ] Specific task in progress (XX% complete)

### Next 15 Minutes
- [ ] Planned next task
- [ ] Integration to complete

### Decisions Made
- Decision: Reason and impact

### Blockers/Issues
- Issue: Description and plan to resolve
```

### **Development Quality Gates**
Before moving to next component:
- [ ] **Code**: All methods have docstrings and type hints
- [ ] **Tests**: Basic unit tests written and passing
- [ ] **Integration**: Interfaces work with existing components
- [ ] **Documentation**: README updated with usage examples

- ‚ùå Don't leave broken code for next session

### **Session Closing**
- ‚úÖ Create detailed handoff even if everything seems obvious
- ‚úÖ Test all completed functionality before closing
- ‚úÖ Update all tracking documents
- ‚ùå Don't end without clear next steps
