## 🧪 Testing Framework Standards

### Unit Testing Requirements
```python
# Backend Unit Test Standards
class TestComponentName:
    """Component-specific test class with full coverage."""
    
    def test_positive_scenarios(self):
        """Test all expected behaviors."""
        pass
    
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        """Test boundary conditions."""
        pass
    
    def test_error_conditions(self):
        """Test all error paths."""
        pass
    
    def test_integration_points(self):
        """Test component interfaces."""
        pass
```

```typescript
// Frontend Unit Test Standards
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should handle all user interactions', () => {
    // User behavior testing
  });
  
  it('should manage state correctly', () => {
    // State management testing
  });
  
  it('should handle error states gracefully', () => {
    // Error handling testing
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing Requirements
- **API Testing**: All endpoints tested with realistic data
- **Database Testing**: CRUD operations and constraints verified
- **Event Bus Testing**: Message publishing and consumption verified
- **UI Integration**: Component interaction and data flow tested

### Performance Testing Requirements
- **Load Testing**: Normal operational load simulation
- **Stress Testing**: Maximum capacity identification
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden load increase handling
- **Volume Testing**: Large dataset processing verification

## 📋 Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation Requirements
```python
# Python Documentation Standard
class ComponentManager:
    """Manages component lifecycle and interactions.
    
    This class provides centralized management for all Guardian Pro
    components, including initialization, configuration, and shutdown.
    
    Attributes:
        components: Dict of active component instances
        config: System configuration object
        
    Example:
        manager = ComponentManager(config)
        manager.start_component('threat_detector')
    """
    
    def start_component(self, component_name: str) -> bool:
        """Start a specific component.
        
        Args:
            component_name: Name of component to start
            
        Returns:
            True if component started successfully
            
        Raises:
            ComponentError: If component fails to start
        """
